openeye-generated pdb ("NH4") and mol2 ("<0>") residue names replaced with "AMM"

in original pdb file, hydrogen atoms had names "H 1", "H 2", "H 3", and "H 4",
   to get them to match with the atomtypes from the ammonium.gaff.mol2 files
   had to change them to "H", "H1", "H2", and "H3" respectively so that the
   atom types would match after creating the `ammonium.lib` file

original charge of gaff.mol2 file was 1.002, spread out the -0.002 needed over
all atoms equally, with -0.0004 added to each charge in _fixed_charges.gaff.mol2
