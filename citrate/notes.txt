residue name was changed from "UNL" in the pdb file and "<0>" in the mol2
    file (from openeyetools) to "CIT"

antechamber used to go from the original mol2 file to `citrate.gaff.mol2` file
    with bcc charges and a total charge of -2

parmchk2 used to create `citrate.frcmod` file

tleap loaded with GAFF and FF99SBildn forcefields
- `citrate.frcmod` file loaded with `loadamberparams`
- `citrate.gaff.mol2` file loaded in as unit `CIT` and checked
- `citrate.lib` file created with `saveoff`

charges in citrate.gaff.mol2 fixed with `fixing_charges.py`
still off by -0.000007, spread out over the last decimal
place of the chrages on the oxygens
